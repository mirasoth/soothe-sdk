    """Emit a progress event from a plugin subagent node.

    This function provides a stable API for plugin authors to emit
    custom events. It works in two modes:

    1. **Standalone mode** (when running outside a host runtime): Only logs
       the event if a logger is provided.

    2. **Host mode** (when running inside a LangGraph context): Both
       logs and calls the stream writer callback to send the event to
       the TUI/CLI.

    Plugin authors use this in their subagent graph nodes:

    ```python
    from soothe_sdk.plugin import emit_progress
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


    def my_graph_node(state):
        # ... do work ...

        event: The event dict or object to emit. If a Pydantic model,
               its `.to_dict()` will be called if available.
        logger: Optional logger to log the event. If None, only stream writer is called.
